        <h2>How to Make Rendang</h2>
        <p>The sauce in this amazing Indonesian curry might be invisible, 
            but you'll know it's there. As it reduces, the water evaporates, 
            leaving behind the fat and flavor that make this dish so unique 
            and addictive. Originally, cooking meat this way helped preserve 
            it in hot and humid Indonesia. Turns out, people continued 
            making it long after refrigeration came around. Serve with 
            steamed rice, garnished with cilantro and lime if desired.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut beef chuck.</li>
            <li>Combine shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, 
                serrano and Fresno chiles, salt, red pepper 
                flakes, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, and 
                nutmeg in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 
                until paste is very finely ground, stopping 
                occasionally to scrape down the sides with a 
                spatula.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the 
                curry paste. Cook and stir until it starts to 
                dry out, then stir in the beef. Add coconut 
                milk, tamarind paste, and brown sugar. Stir 
                to combine. Fill up the empty can of coconut 
                milk with water and pour it into the pan. 
                Increase heat to medium-high; bring to a 
                simmer.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, bruise lemongrass with the 
                back of your knife. Cut into 1- to 2-inch 
                pieces and add to the curry. Reduce heat to 
                medium. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                until beef is fork-tender and sauce is fully 
                reduced, about 4 hours. Stir more frequently 
                as water reduces; add more water or lower the 
                heat if sauce is reducing faster than beef is 
                softening.</li>
            <li>Remove lemongrass to serve. For best results, 
                let cool and serve the next day.</li>
        </ol>
