# odin-recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project Foundations Course. So far, I have learned about web development, command line, git and GitHub, and HTML coding.

In this project, I built simple webpages about recipes. There is one homepage containing all the links to the recipes. Currently, there are three available recipes, which are lasagna, pecan chicken salad, and rendang. I only used HTML for this project. As for the styling with CSS, it will be added later after I learned it in next courses.
